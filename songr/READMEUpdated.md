## Lab 11 Building Full-Stack Web Apps

### Feature Tasks:


-  hello world route at /hello
- /capitalize route that turns words into UPPER CASE. 
- basic splash page for the Songr app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.
- Album class to act as a model in our app.
- Album with title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that album’s art.
- route at /albums that shows three album instances. (These will be hardcoded for today’s lab; create an array that contains three albums, and then display those three on the page.)

-  - To use my userInput Capitalize route. Simply add /capitalize/"What you want capitalized here" to the main splash route.
- - To see my albums, visit /albums.

***Thank you Tony for help with importing and attributes. GPT for css styling (need to find IntelliJ)CSS plugin.


## Lab 12 Spring RESTful Routing

### Feature Tasks:


-  Update your Album model so that it can be saved in a database.
- An Album has a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that album’s art.
-  A user should be able to see information about all the albums on the site.
-  A user should be able to add albums to the site.

Please use the /albums route to add an album and then revisit to see the updated list.

I have met the standards above with the exception that I took away the option for the user to input an ImageUrl. Instead
I have it set to insert a stock image until I understand a way to control user imports more.

***Thank you Tony for help with getting PostGreSQL up.
