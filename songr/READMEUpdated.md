## Lab 11 Building Full-Stack Web Apps

### Feature Tasks:


-  hello world route at /hello
- /capitalize route that turns words into UPPER CASE. 
- basic splash page for the Songr app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.
- Album class to act as a model in our app.
- Album with title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that album’s art.
- route at /albums that shows three album instances. (These will be hardcoded for today’s lab; create an array that contains three albums, and then display those three on the page.)

- To use my userInput Capitalize route. Simply add /capitalize/"What you want capitalized here" to the main splash route.
- To see my albums, visit /albums.
